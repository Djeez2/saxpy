Notes from reading papers:

HOT-SAX long-ver.pdf:

should implement non-self distance
-- generally this means that a subsequence beginning at q will be compared
   to one beginning at p only if |p-q| > some constant.  

-- heuristic for determining which subsequences to compare:
   first want to compare maximally different subsequences, and
   set a min_dist_so_far, so you check the most uncommon sax words first.
   Then, you check these against those which are closest to them, which
   the authors used a trie for.  Fairly simple, and you could store this.

Anomaly detection note

-- You could store both of these as json objects, and retreive each for a
   particular metric.
